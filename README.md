xgminer-osx
===========

This project consists of a standard set of shell scripts for creating redistributable packages of [cgminer][6] and [bfgminer][7] for Mac OS X.

![bfgminer](http://nwoolls.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/screen-shot-2013-07-01-at-5-47-22-pm.png "bfgminer")

The [Releases][8] page is used to provide binary downloads for these redistributable packages. All source code comes from official sources.

This project is a collaboration between:

* John - author of [MacMiner][5]
* [Kerry][3] - author of Asteroid
* [Nate Woolls][1] - author of [MultiMiner][2]

Our aim is to provide a single source for the best possible OS X binaries for cgminer and bfgminer until such time as the authors provide OS X redistributables themselves.

### Prerequisites

#### General

* automake
* autoconf
* libtool
* GNU sed
* libevent


#### BFGMiner

* openssl

Install with Homebrew - e.g. `brew install automake autoconf libtool gnu-sed libevent`
